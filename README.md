Climb is an Android app written in Java, that works on basis of pressure sensor. Climb allows you to measure your altitude, to make a climb, and measure its highest and lowest point as well as time of the climb. Records are stored in SQLite database.

I've created a simple app landing page using free template, you can check it out - [here](https://mystifying-mcnulty-aaf102.netlify.app/)!

*This project was created between December 2020 and January 2021*
